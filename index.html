FitGenie: a web application with a MEAN Architecture (Mongo DB, Express, Angular JS, and Node JS) that is designed to be a workout building and tracking tool for personal trainers to use with their clients. Users build their own workouts with a series of movements, set the designated time limits for each movement, and then use a "workout player" to help them perform those workouts. <a href="portfolio.html/#fitGenie"> READ MORE >></a>

Beyond its use in consolidating the front-end code, it also documents the visual language, such as header styles and color palettes, used to create the site. This way, it’s a one-stop place for the entire team—from product owners and producers to designers and developers—to reference when discussing site changes and iterations." <a href="portfolio.html#LSG"> READ MORE >></a>

            About Me
          </h1>
          <p>
            Maggie is UX Engineer and Front-End Web Developer with a very creative background. She has had a passion for making things as long as she can remember, constantly thinking of how to make the world better through her efforts. She dabbled in illustration, typography, and web design as a teenager and went on to study Graphic Design at Massachusetts College of Art and Design. She graduated with departmental honors in 2011.
          </p>
          <p>
            After graduating, life and love pulled her towards the midwest where she became connected with the circus and hula hooping communities in St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri. Though she had only been hula hooping for little over a year, she quickly began well-known teaching and performing in Kansas City. Maggie performed solo and as a part of MoonDrop Circus and Vodville Entertainment Company. During this time she also developed her own performance clothing line - Radiant Threads - and created many custom performance pieces for MoonDrop Circus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout this time, Maggie felt pulled towards UX Design and Development and moved to Seattle for the industrial advancements in the tech community. She recently graduated from Code Fellows’ Front-End Design and Development Accelerator, which has prepared her to jump into the field as a junior developer. She has a passion for problem-solving with fellow designers and developing practical, modular, and scalable solutions that will hold up as web technologies grow. She believes all code should be well designed, not merely written to make things look great and function properly, but laid out to promote efficiency, readability, and scalability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Major coding language skills include HTML5, CSS with a special interest in Sass, JavaScript, jQuery, the command line, and development environments such as Angular, Express, Ember, and Node.
          </p>
          <p>
            She is very familiar working on a team, working within version control systems like Github, developing user research and user flow, and maintaining visual consistency and an attention to detail throughout projects.
